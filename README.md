# Security-policy-development-Project

Bitra Immigration and Border Services Policy Development Project

This repository contains customized SANS security policy templates adapted for Bitra Immigration and Border Services, a fictional cybersecurity company.  
The project demonstrates my skills in security policy development, documentation management, and version control using GitHub.


These policies have been tailored to the operational and regulatory framework of an immigration and border service, ensuring proper handling of passports, visa records, and financial documentation.
